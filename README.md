# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction using LSTM

## Overview
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to analyze and predict stock market prices. The model uses historical stock data to forecast future stock prices, leveraging deep learning techniques for time series prediction.
